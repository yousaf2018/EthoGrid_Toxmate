**EthoGrid-ToxMate** is a specialized, high-performance desktop application engineered for researchers working with large-volume behavioral data, such as 24-hour recordings from automated systems like **ToxMate**. It provides a massively accelerated, end-to-end workflow to take you from raw, multi-hour videos to final, publication-ready statistical reports and graphs in a fraction of the time.

Every stage of the EthoGrid-ToxMate pipeline is designed to be **transparent, customizable, and efficient**, giving you full scientific control over your high-throughput data.

## The EthoGrid-ToxMate Philosophy: Speed and Control for Big Data

Designed specifically to address the challenges of long-duration recordings, EthoGrid-ToxMate eliminates the bottlenecks of traditional analysis. It provides a single, unified platform optimized for speed:

1.  **High-Speed Video Preparation**: Automatically split massive 24-hour recordings into manageable 1-hour chunks with a single click, preserving original quality without slow re-encoding.
2.  **GPU-Accelerated AI Tracking**: Run high-performance YOLO models using an optimized process that maximizes GPU utilization, generating tracking data at high speeds.
3.  **Rapid Annotation & Cleaning**: Interactively align a virtual grid to your experimental setup once, then apply it to hundreds of video segments automatically in a powerful batch processing workflow.
4.  **Interactive Endpoint Calculation**: Compute a rich set of scientific endpoints with a powerful interactive tool. Visually validate and fine-tune parameters like the true center of each tank before running the final batch analysis.
5.  **One-Click Statistical Analysis**: Perform a full suite of statistical tests (T-test, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, etc.) across multiple custom-named experimental groups and all relevant endpoints simultaneously, generating a folder of publication-quality plots and a consolidated data report with a single click.

## Key Features

-   **Optimized for High-Throughput**: Every module, from video splitting to statistical analysis, is designed to work in batch mode on large numbers of files, saving countless hours of manual work.
-   **High-Performance Processing**:
    -   **YOLO Inference**: Automatically detects and utilizes NVIDIA GPUs for massive speed improvements, with a graceful fallback to CPU.
    -   **Video Resizing**: Leverages NVIDIA GPU hardware acceleration (`h264_nvenc`) for extremely fast video downscaling.
-   **Interactive Grid System**:
    -   Define a virtual grid and interactively translate, rotate, and scale it for perfect alignment.
    -   **Settings Persistence**: Save and load complex grid configurations to a JSON file, ensuring reproducibility.
-   **Advanced Batch Processing & Data Cleaning**:
    -   Apply a saved grid configuration to entire datasets automatically.
    -   Filter detections within each tank to keep only the highest-confidence animal per frame.
-   **Comprehensive Data Export**:
    -   Generate annotated videos, trajectory plots, heatmaps, and multiple data formats (`.csv`, `.xlsx`).
-   **Interactive & Customizable Endpoints Analysis**:
    -   A dedicated module for calculating behavioral endpoints with visual validation.
    -   **Flexible Analysis Modes**: Switch between "Top View" and "Side View" modes with different parameters and endpoint calculations.
    -   **Per-Tank Customization**: Define different zone division axes for each individual tank to handle complex camera angles.
-   **Publication-Ready Statistical Analysis**:
    -   **Intelligent Test Selection**: Automatically performs normality tests and selects the appropriate significance test (T-test/ANOVA vs. Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis).
    -   **Full User Control**: Override automatic test selection and customize every aspect of your plots (colors, fonts, sizes, error bars, mean/median).
    -   **"Analyze All" Functionality**: Analyze all selected endpoints across multiple custom-named experimental groups with a single click.

## Standalone Utilities

-   **Video Splitter**: Optimized for splitting multi-hour recordings (e.g., 24-hour ToxMate videos) into manageable chunks without quality loss.
-   **Frame Extractor**: A powerful tool for creating datasets by recursively finding all videos in a directory and extracting random, traceable frames.
-   **Video Quality Control**: A high-speed, GPU-accelerated tool to downscale large video files (e.g., 4K to 1080p), saving disk space and speeding up subsequent analysis.

## The Complete Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

This workflow demonstrates how to go from a raw video to a final statistical graph.

1.  **Prepare Video (Optional)**: Use the **‚úÇÔ∏è Video Splitter** to cut a long recording into 1-hour segments.
2.  **Generate Tracking Data**: Use **üé® Run YOLO Segmentation...** to run your trained model on the video segments. This produces a raw `_segmentations.csv` file for each.
3.  **Annotate Data**: In the main window, **üé¨ Load** a sample video and the corresponding `_segmentations.csv`. Interactively create and align the grid, then **üíæ Save Settings** to a `grid.json` file.
4.  **Batch Process**: Use **üöÄ Batch Annotation...** to apply your saved `grid.json` to all your video segments and their `_segmentations.csv` files. This will generate the final, clean `_with_tanks.csv` files.
5.  **Calculate Endpoints**: Use **üìà Run Analysis...** to process your `_with_tanks.csv` files. In this interactive dialog, you can fine-tune tank centers and other parameters, then run the analysis to produce a `consolidated_endpoints.xlsx` file.
6.  **Perform Statistics**: Use **üìä Statistical Analysis...** to load your `consolidated_endpoints.xlsx` files, assign them to Control and Treatment groups, select the endpoints you want to compare, and run the analysis. The result is a folder of publication-quality plots and a final statistical report.
